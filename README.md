# GPS-Anomaly-Detection
Goals for modeling at the moment,  feel free to specify what you plan to do: 
<br>
Keegan: XGBoost on a a few different locations, select attributes this way and recompute the aggregated csv with only those attributes; try tbd classifiers using the new csvs. <br>
Cameron: Run PCA on location07, select the filtered attributes and recompute on the aggreagted csv. Plug those PCA results into a logisitic regression model and interpret/try to improve those modeling results
<br>
Kelly: Run PCA on Keegan's dataset. Input principle components into logostic regression. If the results are bad from this, then I may select the top feature from each component and run logistic regression on that.
